<h1>Using CMake to Build Hercules Version 4.0</h1>
<hr />
<h2>CMake Build Questions and Answers</h2>

<p><strong>What happened to using autogen.sh and configure to build Hercules?</strong></p>
<p>They are still there. You may continue to use autotools 
(autogen.sh, configure, and make) to build Hercules for the moment. 
But the time will come when the autogen.sh and configure build for 
Hercules is deprecated and, later, removed.
Much like Cygwin/MinGW builds for Windows. 
</p>

<p><strong>Can I still use the <code>1Stop</code> script?</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, and if you use <code>1Stop</code>, 
you will use autotools,
configure,
and make to build Hercules.
</p>

<p><strong>What if I like <code>1Stop</code> and want to build with CMake? </strong></p>
<p>If your system is set up to use <code>1Stop</code> and you wish to build with
CMake, use the <code>1Stop-CMake</code> script.  
The <code>1Stop-CMake</code> script builds Hercules in the same manner as <code>1Stop</code>,
but it uses CMake rather than autotools to create the build files.
</p>

<p><strong>What about Windows?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, 
you cannot use CMake to build Hercules for Windows.  
The next major version of the CMake build for Hercules will support
Windows builds.
</p>

<p><strong>Does the CMake build work on Apple?</strong> </p>
<p>Maybe.  We welcome testers.  An early test report showed that CMake
completed, SoftFloat-3a built successfully, but Hercules failed to
compile.  
</p>

<p><strong>I tried it, but it did not work.  What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Please see <a href="index.html#What_To_Do_When_it_Fails">What To Do When it Fails</a>.  
And while the issue is being sorted out, 
you can build using autogen.sh and configure.
</p>

<p><strong>I reported a problem.  When will it get fixed?</strong></p>
<p>The CMake build, like all of Hercules, is supported by volunteer
developers, conscientious programmers who hate to see their work
fall short.  But all of us have other demands on our time, so things
may not be corrected as quickly as any of us would wish. 
</p>
<p>And of course, if you see the solution to an issue and are willing
to share, we welcome your contribution. </p>
