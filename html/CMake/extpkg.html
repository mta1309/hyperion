<h1>Using CMake to Build Hercules Version 4.0</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Controlling the Automatic Build of External Packages</h2>
<p>The CMake build for Hercules will clone and build all required external
packages into the location specified or defaulted to in 
<code>-DEXTPKG_DIR</code>.
An external package is one which resides in its own repository and is
built separately from Hercules.
</p>
<p>Hercules presently uses one external package, 
SoftFloat-3a For Hercules.
Other packages might also become external packages in the future,
for example in Windows Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, BZIP2, and ZLIB.  
The decNumber package and the html directory may also be split 
into external packages just as SoftFloat-3a For Hercules was split.
</p>

<p>The autotools build for Hercules expects external packages to have been
previously built either by the person doing the build or by the <code>1Stop</code>
script.  
The package(s) were expected to be installed at specific
location(s) relative to the Hercules build directory.  
An autotools <code>--enable</code> option allowed the builder 
to specify a location other than the default.
</p>
<p>The CMake build uses its own capabilities and the capabilities of git
and the  generator (e.g., Unix Makefiles, Ninja, or Xcode) to build
the external package or components of the package only when required
by updates to the package.  
Package updates include commits to the remote repository and 
alterations to source files, 
such as might be performed by an external package developer.
</p>
<p>Command line options are provided to enable control of this automation.
</p>

<h4><code>-DS3FH_DIR=&lt;path&gt;</code></h4>
<p><code>&lt;path&gt;</code> may be absolute or relative to the Hercules build directory.
</p>
<p>The <code>-DS3FH_DIR</code> option is most useful to external package developers who
are modifying an external package and wish to test changes pre-commit.
</p>
<p>This existing option names the path to a previously built and installed
external package.  It is the builder's responsibility to do the build;
CMake will not automatically build an external package when an
installation directory has been specified.
</p>

<h4><code>-DEXTPKG_DIR=&lt;path&gt;</code></h4>

<p><code>&lt;path&gt;</code> may be absolute or relative to the Hercules build directory.
</p>

<p>The <code>-DEXTPKG_DIR=&lt;path&gt;</code> option is most useful to Hercules developers who may have multiple
Hercules build directories, 
or who wish to erase and recreate the build
directory without rebuilding all external packages.
</p>

<p>This option specifies the path that the CMake build will use as the root of all
package directories for those external packages that CMake will build.
The external package directory structure looks like this:
</p>

<table style="margin-left: 40px">
    <tr>
        <td><code>extpkg/</code></td>
        <td>All external packages are placed in <code>extpkg/</code>,
            with a separate subdirectory per package
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>extpkg/&lt;pkgname&gt;/</code></td>
        <td>directory for one external package, named "pkgname"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>extpkg/&lt;pkgname&gt;/pkgsrc</code></td>
        <td>source directory, generally from a git repository.</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
        <td><code>extpkg/&lt;pkgname&gt;/build</code></td>
        <td>build directory for an external package.</td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
        <td><code>extpkg/&lt;pkgname&gt;/install</code></td>
        <td>install directory for the built package</td>
    </tr>    
</table>

<p>The default value for this directory is <code>&lt;build-dir&gt;/extpkg</code>, 
which causes CMake to build all external packages in the Hercules build directory
tree.  
This default enables a casual builder to build Hercules without
having to be aware of external packages at all.  
And should the casual builder tire of Hercules, 
deleting the build directory also deletes the
external package repositories, builds, and installation directories.
</p>
<p>Note:
<code>-DS3FH_DIR</code> and <code>-DEXTPKG_DIR</code> 
may both be specified for a given build.
If they are, then CMake will use the pre-built SoftFloat-3a For Hercules
and will build all other external packages (currently none) in the
directory specified by <code>-DEXTPKG_DIR</code>.  
The directory specified by <code>-DEXTPKG_DIR</code> will be created.
