<h2>Release notes for release 4.00</h2>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>Minimum supported Windows platform is now Windows XP x64 or greater
  <dd>
  <p>
    The new minimum supported Microsoft Windows platform is now Windows XP x64
    or Windows Server 2003 or greater. Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and
    32-bit Windows XP are no longer supported.
    <blockquote>
        <small>
            <b>NOTE:</b> Since neither Windows XP x64 nor Windows Server
            2003 are supported any longer by Microsoft either (extended
            support for both ended on April 2014 and July 2015 respectively),
            Hyperion support for them will be dropped in the
            <i><u>very</u></i> near future as well. All Hercules users
            running either of these operating systems are
            <i><u>strongly</u></i> encouraged to upgrade as soon as
            possible to Windows Vista or Windows 7 Professional SP1 x64
            or greater.
        </small>
    </blockquote>
  </p>

  <dt>"MAXCPU" and "NUMCPU" statements
  <dd>
  <p>
    The combination of <a href="hercconf.html#NUMCPU">NUMCPU</a> and
    <a href="hercconf.html#MAXCPU">MAXCPU</a> controls the behavior of how many
    CPU engines will be configured online upon startup and how many can be
    configured online later. In previous versions this was controlled via
    the NUMCPU statement and the compile-time constant 'MAX_CPU_ENGINES'.
    </p><p>
    For compatibility with previous versions of Hercules, if MAXCPU is
    not specified its value defaults to NUMCPU. If neither is specified
    it defaults to 1.
  </p>

  <dt>New and improved CMPSC Compression Call 2012 instruction implementation is now the default
  <dd>
  <p>
    The default implementation for the CMPSC Compression Call instruction is
    now the new cmpsc_2012 implementation. The previous legacy implementation
    is now the alternate implementation implemented as an optional dynamically
    loadable module called "altcmpsc.dll". Refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.CMPSC">README.CMPSC</a>
    document of the source code distribution for more information.
  </p>

  <dt>The sequence of certain system parameters may be important
  <dd>
  <p>
    The sequence of certain configuration file system parameter statements
    may be important. Specifically, the
    <code><a href="hercconf.html#ARCHLVL">ARCHLVL</a></code>
    statement (previously called <code>ARCHMODE</code> and defines the
    initial architectural mode of the system) should generally precede
    (come before) any other <code>ARCHLVL</code> statement that enables
    or disables a given architectural feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example: on certain IBM operating systems the z/Architecture "ASN
    and LX Reuse Facility" feature must be enabled or the system will not IPL.
    The facility is enabled in Hercules via the
    <code><a href="hercconf.html#ARCHLVL_FACILITY">ARCHLVL ENABLE ASN_LX_REUSE</a></code>
    configuration file statement, but since the facility is a z/Architecture-only
    feature, your initial architecture must either be set to "z/Arch" beforehand
    or else you need to specify the optional <code><em>[archmode]</em></code>
    parameter on your <code>ARCHLVL ENABLE ASN_LX_REUSE</code> statement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means the <code>ARCHLVL z/Arch</code> statement must usually come
    <i>before</i> your <code>ARCHLVL ENABLE ASN_LX_REUSE</code> statement
    in your configuration file. Otherwise the ASN and LX Reuse Facility would
    not be enabled.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>ARCHLVL</code> statement is currently the only system parameter
    whose sequence may matter. The order of all other system parameters does
    not currently matter. This may change in the future however, so be sure
    to always carefully read through the RELEASE NOTES (this document) with
    each new release of Hercules.
  </p>

  <dt>More architecturally compliant Channel Subsystem implementation
  <dd>
  <p>
    Hercules 4.0 Hyperion's channel subsystem implementation now more closely
    adheres to published and unpublished architectural specifications. It does
    not precisely adhere to the complete specification but it does adhere much
    more closely than ever before (and definitely more closely than the legacy
    implementation still used in the older spinhawk 3.xx series of Hercules).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you experience any anomalies in the behavior of your guest operating
    system, verify that you are using architecurally valid/correct configuration
    settings that your guest operating system expects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pay <i><u>particular</u></i> attention to your
    <a href="hercconf.html#LPARNUM">LPARNUM</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUIDFMT">CPUIDFMT</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUMODEL">CPUMODEL</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUSERIAL">CPUSERIAL</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#CPUVERID">CPUVERID</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#MODEL">MODEL</a>,
    <a href="hercconf.html#PLANT">PLANT</a>
    and
    <a href="hercconf.html#MANUFACTURER">MANUFACTURER</a>
    values since they typically have a direct impact on how
    certain guest operating systems behave.
  </p>

  <dt>Configuration file statements and panel commands handled identically
  <dd>
  <p>
    Most configuration file statements are now available as and processed as
    panel commands. Most valid configuration file statements may now also be
    entered as a panel command. Most panel commands are now also allowed as
    configuration file statements. See the documentation for full details.
  </p>

  <dt>Integrated Rexx support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Rexx support was first added to Hercules by Jan Jaeger in 2010
    and has been gradually enhanced over the years by both Enrico Sorichetti
    and Jan Jaeger as well as a few other people too.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have <a href="http://www.rexxla.org">Rexx</a> installed on your
    host and Hercules is built with the rexx build option, then rexx scripts
    can be run from directly within the Hercules environment (i.e. directly
    from the Hercules HMC command line) via Hercules's "exec" command.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rexx scripts, when run within Hercules via the 'exec' command, can
    Address the HERCULES enviroment allowing you to issue Hercules commands
    and retrieve the results via the builtin 'awscmd' rexx function call.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information please see <a href="rexxinteg.html">Hercules-REXX Integration</a>, 
    or refer to the
    <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/blob/master/README.REXX">README.REXX</a>
    document and the
    <a href="https://github.com/hercules-390/hyperion/tree/master/scripts">sample scripts</a>
    included in the 'scripts' subdirectory of the source code distribution.
  </p>

    <dt>Hercules may be built using CMake</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A CMake build proceduce has been added for open source and UNIX-like systems.
    The procedure and build options are described in
    <a href="CMake/index.html">Using CMake to Build Hercules Version 4.0</a>.
    </p>
    </dd>

<h2>Release notes for release 3.06</h2>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>Tape "AUTOMOUNT" support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Starting with Hercules version 3.06 a new AUTOMOUNT option is available
    that allows guest operating systems to directly mount, unmount and query
    tape device filenames for themselves, without any intervention on the
    part of the Hercules operator.
    </p><p>
    Automount support is enabled via the AUTOMOUNT configuration file statement.
    </p><p>
    An example guest automount program for VSE called "TMOUNT" is provided in
    the util subdirectory of the Hercules source code distribution.
    </p><p>
    Briefly, the 0x4B (Set Diagnose) CCW is used to mount (or unmount) a file
    onto a tape drive, and the 0xE4 (Sense Id) CCW opcode is used to query the
    name of the currently mounted file.
    </p><p>
    For mounts, the 0x4B CCW specifies the filename of the file to be mounted
    onto the drive. The file MUST reside in the specified AUTOMOUNT directory
    or the automount request will be rejected. To unmount the currently mounted
    file, simply do a mount of the special filename "OFFLINE".
    </p><p>
    To query the name of the currently mounted file, the 0xE4 CCW is used. Note
    however that the 0xE4 (Sense Id) CCW opcode cannot be used by itself since
    the drive may also already natively support the Sense Id CCW opcode. Instead,
    it must be preceded by (command-chained from) a 0x4B CCW with a data transfer
    length of one byte. The following 0xE4 command is the one that then specifies
    the i/o buffer and buffer length of where the query function is to place the
    device's currently mounted host filename.
    </p><p>
    In summary:
    </p><pre>
        MOUNT:      X'4B', filename, X'20', length

        UNMOUNT:    (same thing but use filename "OFFLINE" instead)

        QUERY:      X'4B', buffer, X'60', 1
                    X'E4', buffer, X'20', buffersize</pre>
    <p>
    Again please refer to the provided TMOUNT program for a simple example
    of how automount support might be implmented on a guest operating system.
  </p>
</dl>




<hr>
<h2>Release notes for release 3.05</h2>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>Use 'startgui' if starting GUI program via 'sh' command
  <dd>
  <p>
    The 'conspawn' utility used to process 'sh' commands now recognizes a
    specially designed keyword "startgui" to accomodate automatic starting
    of Windows GUI applications via the .RC file or panel command-line.
    </p><p>
    If the first word following 'sh' is "startgui", then the "ShellExecute"
    API is used to start the requested program rather than the 'system()'
    API as otherwise.
    </p><p>
    The "startgui" keyword must always be used to start any Windows program
    that is not a command-line program. Hercules, itself being a command-line
    program, monitors the 'stderr' and 'stdout' pipes so it can log messages
    received from either pipe directly to the Hercules console log. Programs
    such as notepad however, because they are not command-line programs, do
    not use stdout/stderr thus causing Hercules to hang if "start" is used
    instead.
    </p><p>
    This rule applies regardless of how Hercules itself is started (i.e. via
    HercGUI or directly via the command-line) and regardless of whether the
    "start" command is wrapped in a batch file or not. That is to say, using
    the Hercules command "sh batchfile foobar" to start your batch file which
    then does "start notepad %1" still causes Hercules to hang until notepad
    first exits. Instead, you should ask Hercules to "sh startgui batchfile",
    and let the batchfile start notepad however it wants.
  </p>

  <dt>Real SCSI tape drive support
  <dd>
  <p>
    Real SCSI tape drives used with Hercules must provide a certain minimum set
    is "IBM compatible" support in their SCSI command set/behavior in order to
    work properly with Hercules. Furthermore, the Hercules device-type used on
    your device statement in your Hercules configuration file should match the
    the level of support/behavior that they provide.
    </p><p>
    For example, all SCSI tape drives used with Hercules must provide the ability
    to set variable-length blocks as well as long erase-gaps (long erase-gaps
    allows new data to be appended to the end of existing data without having to
    write a tape-mark to separate the new data from the old existing data first).
    </p><p>
    Another example would be using a model of SCSI tape drive that happens to
    report physical block-id values in a format different from the way real IBM
    mainframe tape drives report them. 3480/3490 tape drives for example report
    their block-ids (used in Read Block Id and Locate CCWs) in a very specific
    format wherein bits 1-7 of the high-order byte of the reported 4-byte block-
    id indicates the tape's physical "segment" location of where the lower 22-
    bit block number is physically located on the tape. (The block-id segment
    is used to allow the tape drive to quickly position itself to the approximate
    location where the desired block acually resides on the tape and thus allows
    high-speed positioning for the Locate CCW).
    </p><p>
    If the model of SCSI tape drive you are actually using with Hercules does not
    use this same block-id format however, then it cannot be used with Hercules
    as a 3480 or 3490 model tape drive with specially defined options.
    </p><p>
    If the SCSI tape drive you are using reports its block-ids using a 32-bit
    block-id value (the same way a 3590 model tape drive does), then similarly,
    it should be defined to Hercules as a model 3590 device-type as well (since
    that is how it is behaving with respect the format of the returned blockid
    values). It you wish to define it in Hercules as a model 3480 or 3490, then
    you will need to use specially defined options before it will work properly
    as the model drive you wish it to emulate.
    </p><p>
    With all that being said, it should be noted that PARTIAL support for 3590
    device emulation is possible with judicious use the aforementioned special
    options, but full/complete 3590 support is unlikely due to lack of publicly
    available documentation. Details regarding 3590 CCW handling is restricted 
    (confidential) IBM proprietary information, and is not normally available
    outside of IBM. Not long ago IBM was required by US law to publish such
    information, but unfortunately for Hercules, such is no longer the case.
    </p><p>
    For further information regarding use of SCSI attached tape drives with
    Hercules and their associated specially defined options, please refer to
    the section on SCSI tape drives in the Hercules's Device Configuration
    documentation.
  </p>

  <dt>Internal thread priorities changed on Windows for platform consistency
  <dd>
  <p>
    In order to ensure proper functioning of the TOD clock with older versions
    of guest operating systems, the default values of Hercules's internal thread
    priorities for the Windows version of Hercules were changed to be identical
    to those used by all other supported platforms. Originally, the default
    thread priority values for the Windows version of Hercules were:
    </p><pre>
              ***  3.04 (and prior) Default Priorities  ***

              Thread    Priority           Meaning
              -------   --------   ------------------------
              HERCPRIO     0        Normal Process priority

              DEVPRIO     -8        Above Normal  Thread priority
              TODPRIO      0        Normal        Thread priority
              CPUPRIO      0        Normal        Thread priority</pre>
    <p>
    which caused acceptable performance/functioning on most, but not all, guest
    operating systems. Beginning with version 3.05 however, the prioriries now
    default to:
    </p><pre>
              ***  3.05 (and later) Default  Priorities  ***

              Thread    Priority           Meaning
              -------   --------   ------------------------
              HERCPRIO     0        Normal Process priority

              TODPRIO    -20        Time Critical  Thread priority
              DEVPRIO      8        Below Normal   Thread priority
              CPUPRIO     15        Lowest         Thread priority</pre>
    <p>
    which may on more modern guest operating systems (which handle the TOD clock
    differently than do older less sophticated versions) cause a slight decrease
    in overall performance. If such is the case, the original default priorities
    (and thus the original behavior) can be obtained via addition of appropriate
    HERCPRIO, TODPRIO, DEVPRIO and CPUPRIO control file statements with values
    identical to the original version 3.04 default values.
  </p>

  <dt>Configuration file usability enhancements and Automatic Operator facility
  <dd>
  <p>
    Additional configuration file usability enhancements have been implemented
    in the form of a new 'INCLUDE' (and associated 'IGNORE') statement, allowing
    configuration files to "include" statements from a different named file.
    </p><p>
    Additonally, a new "enhanced" symbolic substitution syntax is now also
    supported. Refer to the Hercules "Configuration File" documentation for
    further information and details.
    </p><p>
    A rather nifty "Automatic Operator" facility has also been implemented in
    the current release as well. While not exactly a "configuration file
    usability enhancement", it is nevertheless something we hope might prove
    to be more useful/helpful to our many users. See the "README.HAO" document
    for more information.
  </p>

<hr>
<h2>Release notes for release 3.03</h2>
<p>Release date: 20 December 2005
<dl>
<dt>New device types 1052-C and 3215-C
<dd>
<p>The new integrated console printer-keyboard is emulated on the
hercules console. Commands are sent to the console by means of a command character.
(default '/', thus a logon command is sent by /logon)</p>
<dt>Message Security Assist
<dd>
<p>Starting from release 3.03 the glibcrypt library is no longer needed.</p>
</dl>




<hr>
<h2>Release notes for release 3.02</h2>
<p>Release date: 11 December 2004
<dl>
<dt>ASN-and-LX-reuse facility
<dd>
<p>This is a new feature of z/Architecture which can cause problems with
certain versions of operating systems running in ARCHLVL=2 mode without
the so-called "Driver 55" fixes. To avoid such problems, specify
<code>ASN_AND_LX_REUSE DISABLE</code> in the configuration file. </p>
</dl>




<hr>
<h2>Release notes for release 3.01</h2>
<p>Release date: 30 November 2003
<dl>
<dt>Library modules and HTTP documents default directories
<dd><p>
An error in the 3.00 configuration script caused many users to have to
override the default modules and HTTP documents directory in the
Hercules configuration file, or by setting an environment variable. This
error has been corrected. Hercules also now reports the actual directory
that it uses by default for these files at startup time. If you specified
the MODPATH or HTTPROOT configuration file statements because you
encountered problems, you should examine the messages printed at startup to
see if the default directories are now correct, and remove the statements
if so.</p>
<p>In general, MODPATH and HTTPROOT should not have to be specified
except in unusual circumstances.</p>
<dt>Windows default directories
<dd>
<p>In conjunction with the fix above, the default directories of the
Windows distributed binaries have been changed. The new directories are
under C:\cygwin\usr\local (which is the same as /usr/local under the Cygwin
environment). No action is needed unless you have specified the MODPATH or
HTTPROOT configuration file entries; if so, see the previous note.</p>
<dt>Message Security Assist
<dd>
<p>Support for z990 crypto instructions is conditional on the presence of the
glibcrypt library.
When Hercules is BUILT, the development files for glibcrypt should be available.
When hercules is RUN, the runtime files for glibcrypt should be installed.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of glibcrypt used to *build* hercules, the associated
level of glibcrypt should also be present on the target machine. On systems
supporting shared library versioning, multiple levels of the glibcrypt
runtime libraries can be installed simultaneously, ensuring availability
of the z990 crypto instructions, regardless of the level of glibcrypt with
which hercules was initially built.</p>
<dt>CTC and LCS device numbers
<dd>
<p>CTC and LCS devices now <i>MUST</i> specify ALL addresses on the configuration
statement.
Previously (i.e. with version 3.00), only the first (even numbered) device
needed to be defined and Hercules would automatically define the odd numbered
device for you. Starting with Hercules version 3.01 however, you now need
to define BOTH devices, just like you did with versions prior to 3.00.
Once again, starting with version 3.01, you **MUST** define BOTH DEVICES.</p>
</dl>




<hr>
<h2>Release notes for release 3.00</h2>
<p>Release date: 3 October 2003
<dl>
<dt>CTCI device changes
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The CTCI-W32 protocol is deprecated. You should use the CTCI
protocol instead.</li>
<li>The VMNET protocol is also deprecated. Not even its author uses it any
more. Every system on which Hercules is now prebuilt has the TUN/TAP
driver functionality available in one form or another, and it's much more
robust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will go away in a future release.</p>
<p>In addition, you <b>must not</b> define both even/odd CTCI device pairs in
your configuration file. You should <b>only</b> define the first even
numbered device. Hercules will automatically define the odd numbered device
for you. If you define the odd numbered device by mistake, an open error will
occur on that device. This is by design. See the README.NETWORKING document
for further details.</p>
<dt>Hercules Dynamic Loader support
<dd>
<p>Starting with version 3.00, Hercules now contains support for the dynamic
loading of certain modules upon startup on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
This support should also work on any platform supported by GNU libtool. As a
result of this new feature, Hercules itself now no longer consists of just the
'hercules.exe' module by itself, but rather consists of both the 'hercules.exe'
program as well as whatever dynamic modules (DLLs) that accompany it.</p>
<p>As a result of this change, whenever you install a new version of Hercules,
you must ensure that you ALSO install the accompanying new versions of the
new dynamic modules as well. Attempting to use a version of Hercules with a
dynamic module that was not specifically built for that version will cause
loading of that dynamic module to fail.</p>
<p>You <b>cannot</b> mix versions of Hercules with differing versions of
dynamically loaded modules.</p>
<p>Ensure that your library path (set by the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH) set correctly such that it includes the directory of your
Hercules dynamic load libraries. If you see message <code>HHCCF042E</code>,
which indicates that the system is unable to locate necessary loadable
modules, this is likely your problem. This should not be necessary if you
have a binary download, but if you're building from source, especially if
you've previously installed a binary package, this should be the first thing
you do.</p>
<dt>ECPS:VM
<dd>
<p>Do not use ECPS:VM (See README.ECPSVM) in an AP or MP environment
in VM/370. If <code>AP=YES</code> or <code>MP=YES</code> is coded in DMKSYS
and the AP/MP control file is used to build the CP nucleus and
<code>NUMCPU</code> is set to more than 1 in the <code>hercules.cnf</code>
file, any of LOK001, LOK003 or other abends will occur. This occurs because
the Hercules ECPS:VM CP Assist implementation is not MP safe, and
particularly, attempts VM dispatching without holding necessary AP or MP
locks.</p>
<dt>Memory allocation on Windows
<dd>
<p>Due to the change in the "mainstor" memory allocation technique used by Hercules to
address a "double memory consumption" bug in Cygwin's malloc implementation,
some Windows Hercules users may experience an "out of memory" error whenever
Hercules is started with a large <code>MAINSIZE</code> configuration file
value:</p>
<p><code>HHCCF031S Cannot obtain nnnMB main storage</code></p>
<p>This error will most likely occur (if it does at all) for those users who
have manually adjusted their Cygwin <code>heap_chunk_in_mb</code> Windows
registry setting value (in order to allow them to specify a large
<code>MAINSIZE</code> value when running Hercules). If this problem does occur
(i.e. if you <b>do</b> happen to experience the above mentioned error with
this new release of Hercules), then either reduce your
<code>heap_chunk_in_mb</code> value (yes, that's correct: <b>reduce</b> it,
as in change it to a <b>smaller</b> value) or else remove it altogether (so
as to let it default).</p>
<p>A complete discussion of this issue is in the RELEASE.NOTES file
in the source distribution.</p>
<dt>Thread priority and other problems
<dd>
<p>There is a known problem with thread priority handling under Mac OS
X. The OS X threading model is different from the one classically used in
Linux. This causes failures to set the timer thread priority, and slow
performance as all of Hercules is set to a low execution priority. This
will be fixed in a future release. A workaround, for now, for slow
performance is to add the statement</p>
<p><code>CPUPRIO 0</code></p>
<p>to your Hercules configuration file.</p>
<p>A possibly related problem is that Hercules fails in random ways when
using the NPTL (new POSIX threads library) library under Linux.
This library is used by default in Red Hat 9, and possibly other systems.
If problems are encountered on a very recent version of Linux, try issuing
the command</p>
<p><code>export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1</code></p>
<p>before starting Hercules.</p>
