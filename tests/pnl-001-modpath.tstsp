*Testcase pnl-001-modpath.tstsp:     Verify modpath settings

#Testcase pnl-001-modpath.tstsp:     Verify modpath settings.
#..Test case ensures Hercules initializes modpath correctly
#..and that the dyncrypt library can be unloaded and reloaded.

# This test is not included in the normal runtest set because the file
# extension of tstsp is not part of the runtest glob.  It is included
# in the test sets constructed by CMake.  Exclusion is needed because
# it reloads crypto from where CMake builds it, not from where
# autotools builds it.

# Note that if the rmmod command fails, it most likely failed because
# the crypto module failed to load automatically during Hercules
# initialization.  Check that possibility first.
