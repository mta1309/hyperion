Function/Operation
- Create commands that run post-build to copy the shared library(s)
  to the Hercules binary directory for use when Hercules is run from
  the build directory.  This is required ONLY for Windows; on UNIX-
  like target systems, CMake assembles a build RPATH that includes the
  directories for dependent targets.  On install, the RPATH is updated
  to point to the Hercules install directory.
- Shared libraries from the following packages are copied in all cases:
  . BZip2
  . PCRE
  . Zlib
- If Hercules was built as a 32-bit application on a 64-bit system and
  one or both REXX interpreters, Open Object Rexx and Regina Rexx, are
  included in Hercules, then their respective shared libraries are also
  copied to the release directory.  The assumption is that the system
  PATH statement points to the 64-bit REXX interpreters, with the
  the result that the 32-bit Hercules will find and attempt to load
  a 64-bit REXX .dll.  This is a bad thing.

Input Parameters
- All parameters are passed as CMake -D options before the -P
  Herc65_ExtPackageWinCopy.cmake option.
- IN1, IN2, and IN3 identify the full path names of the library files
  that are to be copied.  If the path name ends -NOTFOUND, or the path
  does not exist, the file is not copied.
- OUT identifies the directory name of the Hercules target executable
  to which the library files are to be copied.  It is expected but not
  required that -DOUT= be completed with a generator expression that
  identifies the Hercules executable directory.  This approach addresses
  the issue of placing the shared library executable in the correct
  directory for the current build, Release or Debug.

Output
- The external package shared libraries are copied to the directory
  containing the Hercules executable.  This is a de facto requirement
  for execution on Windows.  The generator expression
  $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:hercules> nicely and transparently identifies this
  directory.

Notes
- This script should not be invoked for non-Windows builds, and if it
  is, configure is aborted with an error message.
- This author is not certain what needs to happen for mac OS Xcode
  builds.  Alteration of this script and the process surrounding it
  are distinct possibilities.
